# Open-Images-2019-Object-Detection
This repo is to predict a tight bounding box around object instances.  

The training set contains 12.2M bounding-boxes across 500 categories on 1.7M images. The boxes have been largely manually drawn by professional annotators to ensure accuracy and consistency. The images are very diverse and often contain complex scenes with several objects (7 per image on average).
